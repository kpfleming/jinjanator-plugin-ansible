collection available to templates being rendered using the Jinjanator
tool.

## Usage

The Ansible filters and tests can be used in templates using the same

could not be more true than it is in the Python community; this
project relies on many wonderful tools and libraries produced by the
global open source software community, in addition to Python
itself. I've listed many of them below, but if I've overlooked any
